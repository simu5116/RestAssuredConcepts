		 * Oauth2.0:----
		 * 
		 * When we are using any website and it requires our sign in
		 * so we have option to sign in with out=r google account
		 * so how does exactly this works in backend,
		 * 
		 * does google share password with the website that we are using ?
		 * 
		 * so here comes OAuth authentication
		 * 
		 * OAuth doesn't share password data but instead uses authorization tokens 
		 * to prove an identity between consumers and service providers. 
		 * OAuth is an authentication protocol
		 * that allows you to approve one application 
		 * interacting with another on your behalf without giving away your password
		 * 
		 * OAuth comes with multiple Grant Types
		 * Most used ones are 1.Authorization code
		 *     2.Client credentials
		 *     
		 *     Here we will understand about Authorization code which is the most complex one and
		 *     how backend architecture works 
		 *
